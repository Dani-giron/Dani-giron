## Hi there 👋 I'm Dani

I'm a Software Engineering student with a strong interest in **backend development, software architecture, and real-world systems**.

I care less about buzzwords and more about **how systems are designed, how they scale, and why decisions are made**. I enjoy turning vague problems into structured solutions and learning by building things that actually try to solve something real.

---

### 🚀 Interests
- Backend development and system design
- Software architecture and design patterns
- **JavaScript (JS)**
- Distributed systems and concurrency
- Building SaaS products with a long-term vision

---

### 🛠️ What I’m working on
- **Hostalium** — a private SaaS for restaurant reservation and table management  
  Focused on domain modeling, optimization, and future AI-assisted decision making.
- University projects, but treated as **engineering exercises**, not just assignments.

---

### 🌱 Currently learning
- **React.js**
- **Node.js**
- **Machine Learning with scikit-learn**
- Frontend and interaction libraries such as **GSAP**
- Applied NLP using **nlp.js**
- Clean architecture and modular design

---

### 🧠 How I approach software
- I prioritize **clarity over cleverness**
- I like understanding trade-offs before choosing a solution
- I believe good documentation is part of the product
- I think code should explain *why*, not only *what*

### 📂 About this GitHub
This GitHub is a **curated portfolio**, not a dump of everything I write.

- Public repositories showcase **design, structure, and learning**
- Some larger or product-oriented projects are kept private
- Each public repo is meant to be understandable by someone else reading it
